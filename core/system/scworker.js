/*
In a way I need two kinds of pictures: one is how the binding is actually set up (which is done in the runloop eventually)
and the way changes come in through the binding.

A binding is actually an object to set up a two sided observer: it is an object which installs an observer on both sides.
The reason for it to be an object in itself is that it also allows unbinding this relationship.

In the case of a remote binding / worker binding, it actually means that there are even more observers:
The binding works in a "normal" way, but is bound to an object which is updated from, and sends updates to an object
on the other side of the divide. On that side, you'd have the mirror of this system, which binds to the actual object at hand.

So, the system uses Observable#addObserver and Observable#remoteObserver to set up the relation, though it only does this
at the end of the runloop. The RunLoop being in the picture is an advantage because if for some reason the worker did not respond yet, we can reschedule the connect

When a binding is made, the connect is postponed to the end of the runloop.
The binding is connected at the end of the runloop by adding observers to the observer queue.
The observer queue is processed at the end of every runloop to set up any remaining observers in the queue.
If the tuple to which the observer is pointing does not exist, the observer setup is requeueued.

So, in a way a cross worker observer could work... as in: when the tuple doesn't exist (which it doesn't locally if the targeted object is at the other side)
a request is sent to the worker manager, which checks whether that path exists on the other side. The observer is requeued.
When the path does exist on the other side, the worker manager creates a proxy object.
There are two ways of doing this, being pretending or not pretending.
Not pretending means that the worker manager locally recreates the path, so the binding works in a normal way.
pretending means that tupleForPropertyPath is adjusted to also check the worker manager for a path. If that path exists at the worker manager,
it returns a proxy object for that path.

To me it seems that the pretending system is less likely to cause issues and lighter on the system: only the objects that are actually necessary are created.

it seems that this should work a bit different...
The original idea is that we load a minimal worker which then loads files on demand.
With the import / ES6 module mode that is no longer possible, as importScripts is not supported for webworkers running in ES6 module mode.

So, this means that the worker has to statically import a specific file (say "app.js") which needs to load everything necessary through imports.
There is a bit of an issue here, because if the app has certain views, these views need to be "transported" to the main thread...
technically that might be a simple "trancoding", or trying a real transfer, but because of the recursive nature of SC objects, this might become
complex...
So, let's say that we need some kind of an app.js / a little bit like the core.js of "old days".
Something similar has to be done for anything outside the worker, specifically views.

This app.js will NEED to load this appworker, or SC core needs to have some clever load method, to check whether it is being loaded in a worker or 
in a main thread...

Also interesting is that the workermanager and appworker side can be integrated with the root responder system.


It might in the end be even better to have the separation even further, as in that only the renderers are in the main thread.
The issue with this is though that it might cause other issues, such as handling of events...
perhaps even more threads?
